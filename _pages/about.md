I am currently a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. candidate at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/), fortunately advised by Prof. [Yang Liu](http://www.yliuu.com/)!

My research interests are robust learning with imperfect data (weakly supervised learning), incentive design for data collection, adversarial machine learning.

Previously, I received my Master of Science degree ([Data Science](https://www.brown.edu/initiatives/data-science/home)) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) and B. S. degree in Honors Science (Mathematics and Applied Mathematics) & Honors Youth ([Gifted Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young)) from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).
