I am currently a final-year CSE Ph.D. candidate at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/), recipient of Jack Baskin and Peggy Downes-Baskin Fellowship 2023-2024, fortunately advised by Prof. [Yang Liu](http://www.yliuu.com/)!

My research interests lie in trustworthy machine learning & large language models, i.e., robust learning under real-world constraints (label errors in human-generated data, class-imbalanced learning, group distributional robustness), data alignment in large language models, incentive design for data collection, and generative modeling.

Previously, I received my Master of Science degree ([Data Science](https://www.brown.edu/initiatives/data-science/home)) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) and B. S. degree in Honors Math & Honors Youth ([Gifted Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young)) from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).

News
======
[2024. 04] I joined [Accenture](https://www.linkedin.com/company/accenture/) as an Advanced AI Research Scientist (Senior Manager).

[2024. 02] We have released a preprint on [Measuring and Reducing LLM Hallucination without Gold-Standard Answers via Expertise-Weighting](https://weijiaheng.github.io/). In this paper, we propose Factualness Evaluations via Weighting LLMs (FEWL), the first hallucination metric that is specifically designed for the scenario when gold-standard answers are absent.

[2024. 01] We have released a preprint on [Human-Instruction-Free LLM Self-Alignment with Limited Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06785). In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can self-align LLMs iteratively without active human involvement.

[2023. 08] We delivered a hands-on tutorial on [learning with noisy labels](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/tutorial-noisylabels/home) at IJCAI 2023.
