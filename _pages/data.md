Data
======
**CIFAR-N**

* We provide CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 train images with human annotations obtained from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The dataset and leaderboard will be published recently! And we are looking forward to contributors on the leaderboard of CIFAR-N datasets.

Code
======
**Weakly-Supervised Learning** (learning with noisy labels)

* We are maintain a curated list of most recent papers and codes in Learning with Noisy Labels. Check [here](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Advances-in-Label-Noise-Learning)!

* **CIFAR-N** dataset: dataloader and starter code to learn from real-world noisy labeled CIFAR datasets. Check [here](https://github.com/zwzhu-d/cifar-10-100n)!

* Implementation of multi-class [Peer-Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03231) functions. Check [here](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Multi-class-Peer-Loss-functions)!

* Implementation of the paper [Robust-f-Divergence](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WesiCoRVQ15). Check [here](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Robust-f-divergence-measures)!

**Incentives in Machine Learning**

* Implementation of the paper [Sample-Elicitation](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/wei21c). Check [here](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Credible-sample-elicitation)!
