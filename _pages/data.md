Data
======
**CIFAR-N**

* We provide CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 train images with human annotations obtained from Amazon Mechanical Turk. 

* The dataset and leaderboard are public avaialble [here](http://noisylabels.com/)! 

* Looking forward to contributors (benchmarking efforts) on the leadboard of CIFAR-N datasets.

* 1st Learning and Mining with Noisy Labels Challenge at IJCAI-ECAI 2022 [[link]](http://ucsc-real.soe.ucsc.edu:1995/).

Code
======
**Weakly-Supervised Learning** 

* We are maintaining a curated list of most recent papers and codes in Learning with Noisy Labels. Check [here](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Advances-in-Label-Noise-Learning)!

* **CIFAR-N** dataset: dataloader and starter code to learn from real-world noisy labeled CIFAR datasets [[Code]](https://github.com/zwzhu-d/cifar-10-100n). The dataset website is available [here](http://noisylabels.com/).

* Implementation of multi-class [Peer-Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03231) functions [[Code]](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Multi-class-Peer-Loss-functions).

* Implementation of the paper [Robust-f-Divergence](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WesiCoRVQ15) [[Code]](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Robust-f-divergence-measures).

**Incentives in Machine Learning**

* Implementation of the paper [Sample-Elicitation](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/wei21c) [[Code]](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Credible-sample-elicitation).
