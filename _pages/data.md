Opensource Softwares
======
**Docta**

* [docta.ai](https://docta.ai/) is online. This is a library to help you understand and curate your data.

Key usages:

* Find and fix label errors in LLM Alignment Data, image data, tabular data, etc.

* Detecting rare patterns/features in your data and perform special treatment.


Data
======
**CIFAR-N**

* We provide CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 train images with human annotations obtained from Amazon Mechanical Turk. 

* The dataset and leaderboard are public avaialble [here](http://noisylabels.com/)! 

* Looking forward to contributors (benchmarking efforts) on the leadboard of CIFAR-N datasets.

* 1st Learning and Mining with Noisy Labels Challenge at IJCAI-ECAI 2022 [[link]](http://ucsc-real.soe.ucsc.edu:1995/).


Code
======
**Weakly-Supervised Learning** 

* We are maintaining a curated list of most recent papers and codes in Learning with Noisy Labels. Check [here](https://github.com/weijiaheng/Advances-in-Label-Noise-Learning)!
